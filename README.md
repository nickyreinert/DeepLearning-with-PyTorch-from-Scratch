This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks loosely based on the course "Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery book" by DanielBourke (@mrdbourke). 

If you have intermediate to advanced Python knowledge and you want to get started with Deep Learning, I strongly recommedn his ~25 hour video which is by far the best introduction and explanation into the topic:

I rewrote and combined most of the lessons, mainly for learnig purposes, to have a cleaned up and filtered basis for further learning. As you wil notice, I try to follow a particular pattern for all notebooks to make it easiere to understand the process. 

The large language model and the stock price part are loosely based on other tutorials and articles, but they perfectly fit into the conecpt, so I merged everything in this repo.
