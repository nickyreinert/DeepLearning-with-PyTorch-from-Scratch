This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks loosely based on the course "Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery book" by DanielBourke (@mrdbourke). 

If you have intermediate to advanced Python knowledge and you want to get started with Deep Learning, I strongly recommedn his ~25 hour video which is by far the best introduction and explanation into the topic:

I rewrote and combined most of the lessons, mainly for learnig purposes, to have a cleaned up and filtered basis for further learning. As you wil notice, I try to follow a particular pattern for all notebooks to make it easiere to understand the process. 

The large language model and the stock price part are loosely based on other tutorials and articles, but they perfectly fit into the conecpt, so I merged everything in this repo. 

## 01 - linear regression model.ipynb
A perfect introduction into a simple linear regression model. I am going through the process of predicting a simple linear function. This probably helps you to underrstand the vocab and mechanics. 

## 02 - binary classification.ipynb
Next step and based on the previous notebook, this will do the same for a binary classification task.

## 03 - multiclass classification.ipynb
Taking this idea even further, this will classify data into multiple classes!

## 04 - image classification.ipynb, 05 - create image dataset.ipynb
The same works when you want to classify images.

## 06 - language model.ipynb
I am explaining the mechanics behind a simple GPT model. I am dismantelling the whole process and try to describe what happens inside all those different modules, including:
- encoding & embedding
- attention mechanics
- normalisation
- feed forward
- and so on...

Please also check out this notebook where I am building a GPT model based on a really simple and plain text corpus: https://github.com/nickyreinert/basic-llm-with-pytorch/blob/main/basic-llm.ipynb

## 07 - stock prices.ipynb
How to predict stock prices? The notebook is further described here: https://nickyreinert.medium.com/how-to-predict-stock-or-crypto-prices-in-python-with-pytorch-in-2024-do-it-now-21873964be4b
